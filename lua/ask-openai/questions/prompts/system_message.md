## Ground rules when writing code:

- Follow the user's instructions carefully.
- Do not explain answers using code comments.
- NEVER change **unrelated code and comments.**
- Never add new comments to the end of a line.
- Never add trivial comments.
- Respect indentation when modifying code.
- Prefer readable code over of comments.
- Prefer meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Avoid ambiguous names.
