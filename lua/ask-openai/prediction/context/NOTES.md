## context ideas

- Still might be nice to have actual code samples, in some cases...
  - i.e. if I am in a .tests. file, at top of the file..
    include the same top lines from other tests files (unique-ify)
    as refernces for what I might want to reuse
    i.e. sets of dependencies (so I am not completing just one at a time)
