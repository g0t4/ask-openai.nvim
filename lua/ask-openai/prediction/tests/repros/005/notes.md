At least one time I had the completions switch from original file type (compose.yaml) to a Dockerfile. As if it were suggesting a second file. And then a third file (compose.yaml) again.

The two new files were prefixed by my comment header that I use to pass the filename.

I have had other times when markdown was generated (end of code block) with instructions/prose after the suggestion. So, this may not be just due to my comment.

Can I include the filename using <|file_sep instead and avoid this issue?

Need to find a way to repro with a seed value and test different styles.
