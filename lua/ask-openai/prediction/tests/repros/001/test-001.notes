## describe example

position cursor on line 7 (0-based => #6)
   at column 8 (on the "i" in "envi")
in normal mode:
   type "A" for append at end of line
let completion start and then review logs
current line was duplicated
  s/b in prefix before <|fim_suffix|>
  was also prepended to suffix => right after <|fim_suffix|>
lead to repeating most of the file as the suggestion
  also has issue of not EOT'ing appropriately, that will be separate test cases
