I want to add an inprocess tool to allow models to track a plan of action to break down a request. Basically it helps them think in terms of overall steps that need accomplished before they complete a task/request. This should espeically helpw ith bigger requests or requests that have alot of minutae to complete and the plan tracks that so the model can focus on one task at a time.

By the way I have other inprocess tools already, they run inside neovim, i.e. semantic_grep. 

The model should be able to:
- add initial steps to the plan
- along the way, add/remove/replace steps
- change status of steps too (simple status: pending, WIP, done)
- this information should be kept in-memory

First, why don't you create a plan here in the chat thread and let me react to it, before doing anything else.
