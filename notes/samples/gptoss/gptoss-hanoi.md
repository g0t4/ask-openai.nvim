<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user: "tower of hanoi in lua please". They want a Lua implementation of Tower of Hanoi. We should provide code, explanation, maybe recursion, maybe iterative? Provide function that solves and prints steps. Should include a main function that calls it with number of discs. Provide explanation. Let's produce a Lua script. Provide minimal code. Possibly also iterative solution or using recursion. Provide sample usage.

Also maybe add a function to return steps as a table.

We should consider typical Tower of Hanoi: three pegs: source, target, auxiliary. The recursive algorithm moves n-1 disks from source to auxiliary, moves nth disk from source to target, then moves n-1 disks from auxiliary to target.

We'll produce a Lua script:

function hanoi(n, from, to, aux, steps)
    if n == 0 then return end
    hanoi(n-1, from, aux, to, steps)
    table.insert(steps, string.format("Move disk %d from %s to %s", n, from, to))
    hanoi(n-1, aux, to, from, steps)
end

Then main:

local steps = {}
hanoi(3, "A", "C", "B", steps)
for i, step in ipairs(steps) do print(step) end

Also optionally print number of moves: 2^n - 1.

We can also show iterative solution: using stack or bit operations. But recursion is fine.

Also provide error checks: n>0.

We might also show a function that prints steps as it goes, to avoid storing large tables for large n.

Also mention tail recursion? Not necessary.

Also mention that Lua recursion depth maybe limited by stack; but n small.

Ok produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Below is a **complete, ready‑to‑run Lua script** that solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle for any number of disks.  
It demonstrates the classic recursive algorithm, prints each move, and even reports the total number of moves (which is `2^n − 1`).

-- Recursively solve the puzzle.
-- @param n   Number of disks to move.
-- @param from  Name of the source peg.
-- @param to    Name of the destination peg.
-- @param aux   Name of the auxiliary peg.
-- @param steps (optional) table that will collect all move strings.

local function hanoi(n, from, to, aux, steps)
    -- Guard against invalid input
    if n < 1 then
        return
    end

    -- 1) Move n‑1 disks from 'from' to 'aux', using 'to' as auxiliary.
    hanoi(n - 1, from, aux, to, steps)

    -- 2) Move the largest disk (disk n) from 'from' to 'to'.
    local move = string.format("Move disk %d from %s to %s", n, from, to)
    if steps then
        table.insert(steps, move)
    else
        print(move)
    end

    -- 3) Move the n‑1 disks from 'aux' to 'to', using 'from' as auxiliary.
    hanoi(n - 1, aux, to, from, steps)
end

-- Helper: pretty‑print all moves stored in a table.
-- @param steps Table containing move strings.
------------------------------------------------------------
local function print_steps(steps)
    for i, step in ipairs(steps) do
        print(step)
    end
end

------------------------------------------------------------
-- Main entry point
------------------------------------------------------------
-- Number of disks – change this value to experiment
local num_disks = 4

-- Option 1: Print moves on the fly (no memory overhead)
print(string.format("\n--- Tower of Hanoi (%d disks) — On‑the‑Fly Output ---\n", num_disks))
hanoi(num_disks, "A", "C", "B")   -- A → source, C → target, B → auxiliary

-- Option 2: Store moves in a table and print afterward (useful for analysis)
local moves = {}
hanoi(num_disks, "A", "C", "B", moves)

print(string.format("\n--- Tower of Hanoi (%d disks) — Stored Moves ---", num_disks))
print_steps(moves)

-- Show the theoretical minimum number of moves (2^n - 1)
local function moves_needed(n)
    return 2 ^ n - 1
end
print(string.format("\nMinimum number of moves required: %d\n", moves_needed(num_disks)))
```

### How it works

1. **Recursion**  
   - The function `hanoi(n, from, to, aux, steps)` follows the classic three‑step recursive recipe:
     1. Move `n‑1` disks from `from` → `aux`.
     2. Move the largest disk `n` from `from` → `to`.
     3. Move the `n‑1` disks from `aux` → `to`.

2. **Printing vs. Storing**  
   - If you pass a table (`steps`) as the fifth argument, the function records each move in that table.  
   - If you omit the table, the function prints each move immediately, which is memory‑efficient for large `n`.

3. **Result**  
   - Running the script prints all moves for the chosen number of disks (default `4` in the example) and confirms that the total number of moves equals `2^n − 1`.

Feel free to change `num_disks` to any positive integer. For large values (e.g., > 20), be aware that the number of moves grows exponentially and the program may take a long time or exhaust the stack (Lua recursion depth is limited). If you need a non‑recursive version for very large `n`, let me know and I can provide an iterative implementation.
