## StarCoder2 FIM notes

- llm.nvim supports starcoder2
    - https://github.com/huggingface/llm.nvim
    - unfortunately llm.nvim doesn't support repo-level FIM:
        - no `file_sep` nor `repo_name`
        - https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ahuggingface%2Fllm.nvim+file_sep&type=code
        - https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Ahuggingface%2Fllm.nvim+repo_name&type=code
    - I have my own fork of this by the way...
